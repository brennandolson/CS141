Create a program entitled Lab3.py which mimics a simple ATM menu system in the following way:

1. Set the initial account balance to $2000.

2. Print the following menu to the terminal
   Welcome to the CS141 Bank
   Please choose either (D)eposit or (W)ithdrawal:

2a If the user inputs something either than d, D, w, or W, print “Invalid
   option” and exit the program.

3. Ask the user for an amount of money to deposit/withdraw.

4. Check the validity of the input (should be a positive floating point
   number). If it is invalid, print “Invalid amount” and exit.

5. Update the user’s balance according to their request. If they attempt to
   withdraw more than their current balance, print “Overdraft” and exit.

6. Print the user’s final account balance.
