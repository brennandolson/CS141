# CS141 - Summer 2018
# Lab 4

Part 1:
Write a program which prompts the user for numbers repeatedly until the user inputs a -1. 
Then return the average of all numbers input by the user, except for the -1 (which is used merely as a flag to stop).

Example interaction
Input a number: 30
Input a number: 2.3
Input a number: 0
Input a number: -2.5
Input a number: -1
The average is 7.45




Part 2:
Write a program which accepts a number n from the user, and then outputs the “hailstone sequence” 
(also known as the Collatz sequence) starting at n.
The “hailstone sequence” is defined as follows:
  If n ever equals 1, stop.
  If n is even, divide n by 2 and repeat.
  If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 and repeat.


Example interaction
Input a positive whole number: 12
Hailstone sequence starting at 12: 12 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
