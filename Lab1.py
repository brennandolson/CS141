# CS141 - Summer 2018
# Lab 1

# Write code to answer the following questions.
# The first question is filled in for you to show how you
#   should format your output.

# Question 0 (simple types):
# Consider the follwing code:
x = 1000
y = 200.4
z = "300"
# What types are x, y, and z?
print ("Question 0:")
print ("x is type", type(x))
print ("y is type", type(y))
print ("z is type", type(z))
print () #empty print outputs a newline

# Question 1 (addition):
# What is x + x?
# What is z + z?
# What happens if you try to run x + z?



# Question 2 (multiplication):
# What is x * 3?
# What is y * 0.4?
# What is z * 4?
# What happens if you try to run z * 1.5?
# What type is x * 3?
# What type is x * 3.0?



# Question 3 (other operations):
# What is 21 / 5?
# What is 2 ** 5?
# What, in words, does ** do?



# Question 4 (cost of a car):
# A certain car costs $20,000.
# The tax rate on the car is 8%.
# Store these two pieces of information as two 
#   sensibly named variables and calculate the
#   final cost of the car using the formula 
#   final_cost = (1 + tax_rate) * base_cost
