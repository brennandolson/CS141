#Caesar Ciphers
In this lab you will implement a simple encryption known as
a “Caesar cipher”. In a Caesar cipher, a message is encrypted by
shifting all of its letters to the “right” in the alphabet by
the same distance, wrapping around from z to a as needed.

For example, if the original message was “a cat”, a Caesar cipher
with a shift of 1 would result in the encoded message “b dbu”.
A Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 would encode “pizza” as “slccd”. Note
that ‘z’ was sent to ‘c’, because the shifting “wraps around” from ‘z’ to ‘a’.

#Problem description
Write a program which first accepts a positive whole number shift from the user.
Then accept a string from the user and return the Caesar shift of the message by 
the shift amount.
You only need to encode the lower case letters, leaving punctuation, whitespace, 
and capital letters unchanged.

An example interaction with this program might look like this

input a shift amount: 3
input a message: I am a pizza fan!
encoded message: I dp d slccd pdq!

#Helpful functions
ord(c) - returns the ASCII value for the character c
chr(n) - returns the character with ASCII value n
s.islower() - returns True if every character in s is a lowercase letter
s1 += s2 - appends string s2 to string s1
for c in s: - loops through each character in a string s

val = ord(c) - ord(‘a’) - sends a lower case letter c to its value in the range 0..25
c = chr(val + ord(‘a’)) - sends a number val in the range 0..25 to the letter in that
position in the alphabet
