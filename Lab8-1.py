# CS141 - Summer 2018
# Lab 8 - lists

# Problem 1 - histogram of items

# Write a function hist(numbers) which takes a list of numbers 
# 0-9 (which may contain repeats) and prints a histogram of their
# frequencies.

# Ex: 
# numbers = [0,3,5,2,5,2,7,9]
# hist(numbers) would print
# 0: *
# 1: 
# 2: **
# 3: *
# 4: 
# 5: **
# 6: 
# 7: *
# 8:
# 9: *

# Hint: create a list of frequencies of length 10 with 
#       all values initially set to 0. Then you can increase
#       the value at position i whenever you encounter i in the
#       input list of numbers.
